Hi,

The point of entire project wasn't about making super quick solution to this particular problem,
but rather to experience how neural networks works from inside.
MNIST dataset served only as helpful tool in order to accomplish this goal.

The maximum accuracy achieved by this algorithm reached 95.5% with several 94-94.5% results,
all depends on given metaparameters.

Results may vary each execution because of random initialization of starting wages and biases!!

Entirety was written with significant help coming from Michael Nielsen's book
(which I therefore strongly recommend  -> http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
followed by his github repository  -> https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/tree/d15df08a69ed33ae16a2fff874f83b57a956172c.

Since you're here, I hope you will find some use of this repository as well.

Thanks!
