Hi,

I tried to make the code as clear as possible, however it's strognly subjective, so it might still look odd to you.

Therefore I will create explanatory comments for each functionality, but I can get to that only from Monday.

With given hyper parameters, network achieves about 80 accuracy after first epoch, going up to 90% while first 10 epochs.
When given 100 epochs as parameter, output presented few results reaching 94.1%.


Highly recommend Michael Nielsen's book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html,
his github repository was helpful as well - https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/tree/d15df08a69ed33ae16a2fff874f83b57a956172c.
